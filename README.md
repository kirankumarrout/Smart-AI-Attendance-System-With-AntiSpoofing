# Smart AI Attendance System with Anti-Spoofing ðŸ’»

## Overview

This project focuses on building a Smart AI-based attendance system enhanced with anti-spoofing technology. The system leverages facial recognition to accurately mark the presence, time-in, and time-out of employees, ensuring high security and reliability. It encompasses various facets such as facial detection, alignment, recognition, and anti-spoofing to prevent fraudulent attempts. Additionally, the project includes a comprehensive web application that facilitates multiple use cases like registering new employees, adding photos to the training dataset, viewing detailed attendance reports, and more.

## Features

- **Advanced Facial Recognition**: Utilizes cutting-edge AI algorithms for accurate facial recognition, even in challenging conditions.
- **Anti-Spoofing Mechanism**: Incorporates anti-spoofing techniques to prevent unauthorized access through photos, videos, or masks.
- **Automated Attendance Tracking**: Automatically marks attendance, along with time-in, time-out, and break times, eliminating the need for manual input.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface for employee registration, dataset management, and viewing attendance reports.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays real-time data insights, such as the number of employees present, total work hours, and break times, through interactive graphs.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Designed to be scalable for use in corporate offices, schools, and other organizations where security is a priority.



## Usage

- **Registration**: Add new employees through the web interface, capturing their facial data securely.
- **Attendance Marking**: Employees simply face the camera, and the system will automatically log their attendance, along with time-in and time-out.
- **Data Management**: View, filter, and analyze attendance records through the web application, with options to export reports.
- **Anti-Spoofing Alerts**: The system will trigger an alert if any spoofing attempt is detected.
